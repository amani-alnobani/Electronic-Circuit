				<h2>Introduction</h2>

				<p>An electronic circuit is a complete course of conductors through which current can travel. Circuits provide a path
					for current to flow. To be a circuit, this path must start and end at the same point. In other words, a circuit must
					form a loop. An electronic circuit and an electrical circuit has the same definition, but electronic circuits tend to
					be low voltage circuits.</p>

        <p>For example, a simple circuit may include two components: a battery and a lamp. The circuit allows current to flow from the battery to the lamp, through the lamp, then back to the battery. Thus, the circuit forms a complete loop.</p>
